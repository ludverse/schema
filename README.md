# skol-schema (school-schedule)

 A sleek schedule viewer I worked on during school on my school computer. Since my school's own schedule viewer was pretty useless, I figured, "It cant be that hard right?".
 
 So about a year has passed and I have been working on it on and off, sometimes during recess, (and sometimes during class!). The complexity has grown quite a lot and maintaining it has become a little troublesome to be honest... But still, the UI/UX design working together to bring an intuative look and feel to it... It's perfect, at least in my opinion.
